  - The sprint goal is in danger again. Thursday and Friday are not days I can count on for productivity. I would be able to meet the goal if I didn't end up spending the time talking with my wife. Don't get me wrong, talking with my wife is important, and I value it, but it eats opportunities to apply for jobs and get what needs to be done done. I also cannot communicate that to my wife. I have to be there for her. This will need to be addressed in the retrospective.
