  - I wish I could do more today, like dive into the tic-tac-toe game, but I need to focus on keeping my spirits high. I can't focus enough for that. I need to be around people, so I'm going somehwhere public and I'm treating myself to something. Not alcohol. I just signed the acknowledgement of my wife's petition, and as much as I'm pretending I'm ok, I'm clearly not. So I need to go out and recover as best I can. Sitting at home being miserable is getting me nowhere quick.

 3. __Do I see any blockers that prevent me from meeting the Sprint Goal?__
  - No blockers besides myself. The biggest blocker is not my job, or my situation. The biggest blocker is me and my emotional health. The more I can stand up and work despite how the world makes me feel, the more work I can do. In classical Chinese culture, there are four plants that represent the virtues of a noble person: Orchid, Bamboo, Chrysanthemum, and Plum. The plum represents courage. At the coldest time of the year, and without any leaves on its branches, it will burst into bloom. It will even bloom though ice and snow coated on its branches. The flowers are small and ususally white, though they can range to pink and deep red. And when they break through the ice, they are often overlooked for their size, especially if they are white. You hardly notice them in the snow. When the plum blooms, it exposes its most delicate side to the worst conditions and yet thrives. In so doing, it breaks the spell of winter and heralds the return of spring. I have to be like this plum blossom. Sorry if that seemed overly sentimental or grandiose, but the story of the plum blossom captivates me. There are no blockers besides my appeasement of ice and snow, and my trepidation to bloom in spite of them.

 3. __Do I see any blockers that prevent me from meeting the Sprint Goal?__
  - I don't like having to stand up to bullies, espeically ones that assume only one relationship dynamic, master/slave, (you're the slave) and are immediately angry, hurt, or insulted if you don't follow along with that assuption perfectly. I had a work colleague do this to me today. My bosses told me I don't have to put up with it. I didn't. But It's still quite tiring to have to tell someone "no" who feels they have every right to command you. As such, the adrenaline from the fight is still in my system, and I'll need to calm down, and get less jumppy if I want to do good work today. That'd be my main blocker. Still, I feel good to be able to stand up for myself.

 3. __Do I see any blockers that prevent me from meeting the Sprint Goal?__
  - I have noticed that I have done precious little reading of Clean Code, nor have I done much in the way of preparing for my next onsite interview. There are reasons for this. I'm afraid certain activities make me look like "I am coding" while others, regardless of their value, do not. I cannot do much of what doesn't look like coding at the moment as I work with another nearby who I am afraid will criticise me for "not coding". Now that may be irrational and not entirely true, but nonetheless I feel it, so I will have to ramp up the courage to do what I need to... but not today. today I'm chickening out. I think I'll save the bravery for next sprint. It's Christmas, and I should enjoy myself. Save the hard growing opportunity for when I have the stength for it :)

  - Start Forking part of algorithm
 3. __Do I see any blockers that prevent me from meeting the Sprint Goal?__
  - I have to watch out for despair, hopelessness and the abuse heaped on my by someone close to me which causes those feelings. I hope I don't have to continue to work in these conditions for much longer, because I'm starting to unravel. If I can maintain myself a little longer to get this project completed, I'll feel better. I need a chance to rest. All I do is work, and deal with abuse. I am not in an environment where rest is possible. I need to at least complete the project, and do my very best to maintain quality for it. I have to find some way to manufacture hope and joy for myself so that I can fuel my work. Maybe coding is the thing. I do enjoy it a lot. I'll do coding and finish this project well. Abuse by someone close to me is my blocker. I can only remove it by pushing through.

  - Complete the new abstraction and integrate it into the code
  - create a better directory structure so that there's not just a jumble of files in the source directory
 3. __Do I see any blockers that prevent me from meeting the Sprint Goal?__
  - Time. And there's a danger that in refactoring this code, I'll have to do surgery on evey class method that calls the new function. I'll probably have to refactor the names sooner or later. And I might need to disinherit Announcer from Scriptographer at some point in the future. This gets into a question about which is worse, inheritance, or importing objects. I suppose it depends on how you implement them, but I can't just rely on Zed Shaw for my opinion, as brilliant as he may be.

  - enjoy the craft
 3. __Do I see any blockers that prevent me from meeting the Sprint Goal?__
  - time. but I should be able to get something done. It's more important to get less done and do it with craftsmanship than it is to get it all done but done poorly. I still have all of tomorrow.

  - continue to find joy in paying attention to the craft. slow down and do good work.
 3. __Do I see any blockers that prevent me from meeting the Sprint Goal?__
  - nah. I will probably need to push just about everything else back a sprint. It might be better to focus on getting all the code looking this nice.

12/3/16
 1. __What did I do Yesterday that helped meet the Sprint Goal?__
  - Continued to build a replacement referee
 2. __What will I do today to help meet the Sprint Goal?__

 1. __What did I do Yesterday that helped meet the Sprint Goal?__
  - identified places that need test coverage
  - since I would need to redo the test anyway as I got into major refactoring, and since my brain was mush, I had the courage to not code. Instead I went to sleep early.
 2. __What will I do today to help meet the Sprint Goal?__
  - refactor the code to repeat itself less (pretty epic)
   - refactor move to be mostly an inherited method from Player
   - find a way to have announcer do all the announcing.
   - create general methods in facilitator or beyond, that allows general scanning of the board
   - X and O should be separate from whether the computer or the human is playing. Tie them to player1 and player2
   - don't allow the board's data structure to be accessed directly.
   - refactor the tests as I go.

So I need to make sure that's squared away before noon, or I know aythm reasonable workaround. Other than that, I need to keep calm and do my best. I'm prepared.

  - Sickness. I'm still pretty sick and I need to sleep, so I will code some and then get some rest. In the retail world, the idea of not coming to work because you're sick is unheard of. If you don't come in to work while you are sick, you are penalized by not being paid that day, or otherwise from having to take a sick day, which there are not an infinite ammount of, or take a social hit because you're not as dependable as they need. So you go into work sick, everyone else gets sick. They all have to come into work too. I hear software development is not like that. I'll have to remember that when telling developers about being sick. They'll expect me to be sensible in a way I haven't been since my school years.

In fact, they really should become a priority until I have habitually unlearned them.

 3. __Do I see any blockers that prevent me from meeting the Sprint Goal?__
  - No blockers, other than not knowing what to do with the sprint. A lot of time at conference. Planning and personal life has convinced me that in order to maintain my momentum, I'll need to pair back the commitment to 30 points. I don't know what will happen this week in that regard. The uncertainty alone will create cognitive overhead which will decrease my velocity, so I prepare for a rough one, personally.

  - There is a high chance I will not be able to complete this, because there's still so much text and description to write. I'll focus on the code first, and meeting the requirements. If I run out of time, I'm moving on. The most important thing is that I code, not write a novel.

  - I had a weird laziness bout this morning, but I should be fine. In years past, I had a tendency to sleep in as a way of hiding from problems I didn't want to face. The code in ex43 is very different from what I've worked with before, so I fell into the old habit of shying away from it. I have found more of a groove now, though. I just have to be aware that this is a habit of mine, and not let it interfere with my productivity.

  - I spent a lot of time last night writing a blog post because I got done a little early. This may actually impact my velocity. I'll have to be careful about pushing more work in during a sprint. I'm happy with the post though, but it looks like it's going to cost me.

I have my Dad flying in to see me Thursday, Friday and Saturday, then my Wife's company barbicue Saturday. Thursday in the morning will be all the time I have. Friday after work when I'm completely exhausted will be my only real chance to code that day. I'll need to get something done Saturday morning before the Barbicue but after Dad has left.

  - The sprint goal is in danger again. Thursday and Friday are not days I can count on for productivity. I would be able to meet the goal if I didn't end up spending the time talking with my wife. Don't get me wrong, talking with my wife is important, and I value it, but it eats opportunities to apply for jobs and get what needs to be done done. I also cannot communicate that to my wife. I have to be there for her. This will need to be addressed in the retrospective.
